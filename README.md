## Replicating the standard printf function in C

A project created as part of my studies at Hive Helsinki.

This project replicates the basic functionality of the printf function, working with the specifiers `c`, `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `x`, `X`, and `%`. 
It was my first experience using variadic functions and processing a variety of arguments to print out characters, strings, pointers, integers, hexadecimals, etc.
